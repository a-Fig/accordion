/*
 * drain.ts — the "drain without reflow" bookkeeping for the protected box.
 *
 * When a block ages out of the protected working tail it should leave an empty
 * slot rather than pulling its neighbours back a cell. Holes accumulate at the
 * FRONT of the protected grid (the oldest end, where blocks depart). We only
 * reclaim that space — letting tiles move — when a whole leading row has emptied
 * out, or when a resize re-flows the grid anyway.
 *
 * This is the pure core of that rule: given the previous state and the new
 * boundary/column count, return how many leading placeholder cells to render.
 * Kept dependency-free so it can be unit-tested without a DOM.
