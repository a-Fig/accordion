/*
 * drop-oldest.ts — delete the oldest non-user blocks to keep the live window under budget.
 *
 * Strategy:
 *  - Trigger: liveTokens > budget * 0.90
 *  - Target:  bring live tokens back down to ~70% of budget
 *  - Eligible region: only blocks OLDER than the protected tail (slice(0, protectedFromIndex)).
 *  - Walk eligible oldest-first. Skip `user` blocks — they express intent and must stay
 *    visible. Every other block is accumulated into the current contiguous run. When a
 *    `user` block is hit (or the loop ends), the accumulated run is flushed as a single
 *    `group` command with `digest: null`, which signals the host to DELETE those messages
 *    from the wire entirely — the agent never sees them. Accumulation stops as soon as the
 *    running removed-token total reaches the remove target.
 *  - A run may be a single block (1-member group); the `GroupCommand` contract allows it.
 *  - Note: tool_call/tool_result pair-balance is delegated entirely to the host's `applyPlan`
 *    Phase A, which guarantees a call and its result are deleted together or neither (an
 *    unbalanced half is left as a straggler). No pairing logic is needed here.
 *  - State: none. Recomputed from the raw baseline every pass (the host clears prior
 *    conductor state before each call, so `liveTokens` is always the unfolded size). Once
 *    live tokens fall back below the trigger threshold, it clears to raw.
 *
 * Locks: "human-steering" + "agent-unfold" (collaborative on tail-size — the human keeps
 * the protected-tail dial). The conductor never touches blocks inside the protected tail.
