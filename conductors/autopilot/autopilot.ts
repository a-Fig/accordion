/*
 * autopilot.ts — Accordion's worked example of a FULLY EXCLUSIVE conductor (ADR 0011).
 *
 * AutopilotConductor declares all three involvement locks:
 *   - "human-steering"  — no manual fold/unfold/pin/group/reset from the human
 *   - "agent-unfold"    — the agent's `unfold` tool is gated
 *   - "tail-size"       — the protected-tail dial is locked; the conductor may fold
 *                         recent blocks (the host lifts its tail floor under this lock)
 *
 * Under the "tail-size" lock the host sets `protectedFromIndex = blocks.length`, so
 * every block arrives with `protected: false`. The candidate filter below therefore
 * naturally includes recent blocks — no special-case needed.
 *
 * STRATEGY: Identical to the built-in (oldest-first, lowest-value-kind-first, greedy
 * fold until liveTokens ≤ budget). The ONLY behavioural difference is that it is
 * allowed to fold recent blocks because the tail-size lock lifts the host floor.
 *
 * This is a PURE function of the view — no `$state`, no store reference, no mutation,
 * no engine reach-in. It consumes ONLY the public `ConductorView`, the same surface any
 * out-of-process conductor gets. It is the worked example: show that an exclusive
 * conductor needs nothing special beyond declaring its locks.
